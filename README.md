## About This Project

Each decade since 1952, the British Film Institute's [Sight & Sound Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound) has been putting out a carefully compiled list of the greatest films of all time. The published lists are usually 10 titles long, but in 2012 they put out a whopping [250 titles](https://fanwithamovieyammer.wordpress.com/the-sight-sound-top-250-list/).

I created the BFI 250 Progress Bar as a way to track my progress through this list. Two important features for me:
- A button to "Skip" films I don't intend to see
- A visually simple progress bar
- Mobile-friendly

## Status

As of January 2021, the front end is fairly mature, but it saves all data to local storage. I am now working on backend integration in order to allow authentication to preserve viewing status across devices.
